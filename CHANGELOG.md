# Changelog

All notable changes to Falsification Engine are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); version
numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pyproject.toml` — installable as `pip install .` with a
  `falsify` console entry point (`falsify:main`).
- `ROADMAP.md` — post-hackathon direction (0.2.0 MCP + Managed
  Agents, 0.3.0 Bayesian stopping, non-goals, discipline note).
- `mcp_server/` — Model Context Protocol server scaffold exposing
  the verdict store as read-only resources and four tool
  functions (`list_verdicts`, `get_verdict`, `get_stats`,
  `check_claim`). Optional install via `pip install -e '.[mcp]'`;
  tool logic is implemented, `stdio_server` SDK adapter is
  stubbed pending SDK version pin.
- `managed_agents/` — Anthropic Console deployment manifests for
  `verdict-refresher` (scheduled, 6-hour cron) and `claim-auditor`
  (on-demand webhook).
- `docs/MANAGED_AGENTS.md` — Console setup guide, cost
  expectations, rollback, security notes.
- `falsify stats --html` — self-contained HTML dashboard with
  dark-mode-aware inline CSS, per-spec cards with state-colored
  badges. `--output PATH` writes to a file. `--json` and `--html`
  are mutually exclusive.
- `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` — reproducible demo environment
  (`docker run --rm -it falsify-demo` fires the auto-demo).
- `docs/DOCKER.md` — quick run, interactive session, repo-mount,
  image size + build-determinism notes.

### Notes

Next: MCP verdict-log server, Managed Agents integration for cloud
verdict refresh, multi-metric specs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Core CLI**: `init`, `lock`, `run`, `verdict`, `guard`, `list`
  subcommands with deterministic exit codes (`0` PASS, `10` FAIL,
  `2` bad spec / INCONCLUSIVE, `3` hash mismatch, `11` guard
  violation).
- **Canonical YAML + SHA-256** hashing for spec locks — the same
  logical claim always hashes identically across machines; any
  semantic edit invalidates the lock.
- **JUJU anonymized sample** (`examples/juju_sample/`) — a 20-row
  prediction ledger fixture with a Brier score metric, for the
  hackathon demo.
- **Additional CLI subcommands**: `stats` (aggregate dashboard
  across all locked verdicts), `diff` (unified canonical-YAML diff
  between the lock and the current spec), `hook install / uninstall`
  (commit-msg guard management with backup), `doctor` (environment +
  repo + per-spec self-diagnostic), `version` (version string, also
  exposed as `--version`).
- **Three Claude Code skills** in `.claude/skills/`:
  `hypothesis-author` (five-question dialogue that drafts a
  falsifiable spec), `falsify` (orchestrator routing empirical
  claims to the right pipeline step), `claim-audit` (lightweight
  text audit with handoff to the `claim-auditor` subagent).
- **Two forked-context subagents** in `.claude/agents/`:
  `claim-auditor` (paraphrase-aware semantic cross-reference of
  arbitrary text against the verdict log), `verdict-refresher`
  (autonomous refresh of STALE / INCONCLUSIVE / UNRUN verdicts).
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/falsify.yml`) —
  unittest suite + `tests/smoke_test.sh` + JUJU end-to-end
  (`lock` → `run` → `verdict`) + guard self-check, plus a dedicated
  skill-lint job that validates every `SKILL.md` and agent file.
- **Documentation**: `README.md` (jury-facing front door),
  `DEMO.md` (five-step runnable walkthrough),
  `docs/DEMO_SHOT_LIST.md` (second-by-second video script),
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (one-page technical overview with data
  flow + invariants), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (ground rules, PR checklist,
  skill/agent recipes), `SUBMISSION.md` (hackathon submission
  draft).

### Notes
